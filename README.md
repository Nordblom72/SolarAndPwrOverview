# Solar and grid power monitoring overview
## Introduction
This github repo holds the documentation files for a solar and grid power monitoring project. The project is about realtime monitoring (granuality of one hour) of the produced solar power as well as monitoring the imported and exported power values.<br/>

MongoDb serves as the database for the whole project. Currently, running on a free-plan account, hosted by MongoDB Atlas Cloud Service.<br/>

Some of the applications are hosted on yet another free-plan account by Netlify Cloud Services. While a few other applications are running on a Raspberry Pi. Mostly becasue these need to be within close proximity to the power sensors that are harvesting the realtime data.<br/>

## Prerequisite
All services are written in Javascript, so nodejs is a most. We also need an MQTT message broker on the LAN. See the HW chapter below as it also describes how to get started with raspberry Pi.

## Overview
The picture says it all :-)

## Applications/Services 

### 1) MODBUS service for collecting solar power data
The company that installed the solar panels refused to share an API key to the fusion solar service for fetching the production data as they had no more keys to share. It would have been the most smooth solution. They also refused to grant me installer rights so that I might enable the modbus on the PV dongle. Luckily, they did enable it for me. That done, this service was born for fetching power values by periodically reading two registers from the inverter and storing them in the MongoDb database.<br/>

### 2) MQTT client collecting power data to/from the grid
This is the MQTT client listening to messages sent from the P1IB power meter. The service saves the monitored data to the MonogDb database. The save periodicy is by default every 5th minute, but is configurable.

### 3) MGTT broker/bus on LAN
Installed Mosquitto MQTT broker on Raspberry Pi, which is an open source and lightweight message broker implementing MQTT protocol. To read more about it, [go to mosquitto.org](https://mosquitto.org/)
Here are the steps to get it running on a Rapsberry Pi:
```
  First, update the Raspberry Pi system software:
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
  
  Install the Mosquitto MQTT broker and the client applications (subscriber/publisher) for testing/experimenting:
    sudo apt install -y mosquitto mosquitto-clients
  
  Edit the configuration file, like the lines below, then save the changes and close the file:
    sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf

    listener 1883
    allow_anonymous false
    password_file /etc/mosquitto/pwdfile
  
  Now create a user & password for the publisher (i.e. P1IB). Enter a password when prompted for it.
    sudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/pwdfile <publisher_user>

  Then, add a new user to the /etc/mosquitto/pwdfile with option -b
    sudo mosquitto_passwd -b /etc/mosquitto/pwdfile <subscriber_user> <password>
  
  Restart the server:
    sudo service mosquitto restart

```
Obviously, the publisher is the P1BL device and the subscriber is the MQTT client.<br/>

### 4) Electricity spot prices service
Didn't find any sites that offered any kind of free-plan accounts for getting the spot prices for electricity. So, had to hack one. The spot prices (day-ahead prices) are normally available at ENTSO-E, the European Network of Transmission System Operators. They provide an API free of charge. But, the day-ahead prices come in EUR/MWh. Found a site that provides an API for exchange rates. That site provides a free-plan that is sufficient for this project. The converted hourly prices go to the MongoDb database.

### 5) MongoDb API service
This is just a simple API service towards the MongoDb database. Manly to be used by the Web service.

ToDo: Add link to the github repo for this service!

### 6) A web client presenting dashboards
This is the web service for presenting a dashboard with some key values and hopefully some nice graphs.

ToDo: Add link to the github repo for this service!

## Hardware

### Solar Power Inverter: Huawei SUN2000 series
The solar power Inverter in this project is: Huawei SUN2000-8KLM, thus the modbus client in this project is tailored for the Huawei SUN2000 series only.


### Power Meter: P1LB
MQTT on P1IB device is disabled by default, so one needs to go to the settings and configure it. Check out the two links below for more info on the P1IB device. <br/>

### Raspberry Pi
The Raspberry Pi used in this project is version 1, model B (I think). Since it is a relic, it is running desktopless.

Tip: To toggle between desktopp and shell login:
```
  sudo raspberry-config

  Then navigate:
  1 system Options -> S5 Boot/Auto Login
  Finish -> reboot
```

Install NodeJS:
```
  cd ~
  wget https://unofficial-builds.nodejs.org/download/release/v20.7.0/node-v20.7.0-linux-armv6l.tar.gz
  tar -xzf node-v20.7.0-linux-armv6l.tar.gz
  cd node-v20.7.0-linux-armv6l
  sudo cp -R * /usr/local
```

Install Java JDK 11. Don't really remember if it is a prereq, but it might be good to have:
```
  cdÂ /usr/lib/jvmsudo wget https://cdn.azul.com/zulu-embedded/bin/zulu11.41.75-ca-jdk11.0.8-linux_aarch32hf.tar.gz
  sudo tar -xzvf zulu11.41.75-ca-jdk11.0.8-linux_aarch32hf.tar.gz
  sudo rm zulu11.41.75-ca-jdk11.0.8-linux_aarch32hf.tar.gz
```

Optionally, install Docker. Not used in the project yet...
```
  curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
  sudo sh get-docker.sh
  sudo docker info
  sudo docker run hello-world
```
