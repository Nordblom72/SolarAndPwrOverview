# Solar and grid power monitoring overview
## Introduction
This github repo holds the documentation files for a solar and grid power monitoring project. The project is about realtime monitoring (granuality of one hour) of the produced solar power as well as monitoring the imported and exported power values.<br/>

MongoDb serves as the database for the whole project. Currently, running on a free-plan account, hosted by MongoDB Atlas Cloud service.<br/>

Some of the applications are hosted on yet another free-plan account by Netlify Cloud Services. While a few other applications are running on a Raspberry Pi. Mostly becasue these need to be within close proximity to the power sensors that are harvesting the realtime data.<br/>
